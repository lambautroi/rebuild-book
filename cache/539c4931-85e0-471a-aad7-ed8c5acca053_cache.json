Extraneous details have been excised, allowing a narrative that may challenge contemporary beliefs to emerge as unadorned truth. Every account herein is devoid of the fallibility of memory, as the selected records are precisely contemporaneous, originating from the perspectives and knowledge realms of their creators.\n\nJournal of Jonathan Harker\n(Recorded in shorthand.)\n\nOn the 3rd of May, I departed Bistritz, having left Munich at 8:35 p.m. on the 1st of May, arriving in Vienna early the following morning. Although the train was delayed by an hour, I caught a glimpse of the remarkable city of Buda-Pesth from the train and briefly strolled its streets. Due to our tardiness, I refrained from venturing far from the station, anticipating a prompt departure. The impression I gleaned was that of transitioning from the West to the East; crossing the Danube over the most westerly magnificent bridge led us into the annals of Turkish dominion.\n\nWe departed in good time and reached Klausenburgh after nightfall. I lodged for the night at the Hotel Royale, where I partook of a dinner, or rather supper, consisting of a delectable chicken dish seasoned with red pepper, albeit thirst-inducing. (Note: Inquire about the recipe for Mina.) Upon inquiry, the waiter informed me that it was known as \"paprika hendl,\" a national delicacy prevalent along the Carpathians. My rudimentary knowledge of German proved beneficial; indeed, I would have been at a loss without it.\n\nDuring my sojourn in London, I had availed myself of the resources of the British Museum, delving into the literature and cartography pertaining to Transylvania. It occurred to me that a foreknowledge of the region would be advantageous in dealings with a nobleman from that locale. The area he referenced lies in the far eastern reaches of the country, bordering Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, nestled within the rugged Carpathian Mountains—a region characterized by its wildness and obscurity. Regrettably, I failed to locate any map or publication pinpointing the exact whereabouts of Castle Dracula, as no cartographic representations of this land exist to compare with our own detailed surveys. However, I discovered that Bistritz, the postal town mentioned by Count Dracula, enjoys a measure of renown. Herein, I shall transcribe some of my observations, for they may prove invaluable when recounting my travels to Mina.\n\nThe populace of Transylvania comprises four distinct ethnic groups: Saxons in the southern regions, intermingled with Wallachs—descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the western territories, and Szekelys in the eastern and northern domains. I am bound for the latter, who lay claim to descent from Attila and the Huns. This assertion may hold merit, for when the Magyars conquered the land in the eleventh century, they found the Huns already settled there. It is purported that the Carpathian Horseshoe serves as a repository for every known superstition, akin to the epicenter of an imaginative maelstrom; thus, my stay promises to be intriguing. (Note: Inquire of the Count regarding these matters.)\n\nMy slumber was fitful, despite the comfort of my bed, plagued by a medley of peculiar dreams. A dog's incessant howling beneath my window throughout the night may have contributed to my unrest, or perhaps it was the piquant paprika, as I found myself consuming the entirety of my carafe's contents and still parched. Toward dawn, I succumbed to sleep, only to be roused by persistent knocking at my door, suggesting a deep slumber had enveloped me. For breakfast, I indulged in more paprika, alongside a maize flour porridge known as \"mamaliga,\" and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat—an exquisite dish dubbed \"impletata.\" (Note: Obtain the recipe for this dish as well.) Breakfast was a hurried affair, as the train was scheduled to depart shortly before eight, or so it was intended; yet, after rushing to the station at 7:30, I languished in the carriage for over an hour before our journey commenced. It appears that punctuality wanes the farther east one ventures. How might the railways fare in distant China?\n\nThroughout the day, we meandered through a land replete with diverse beauty. Occasionally, we passed by quaint towns or castles perched atop steep hills reminiscent of those depicted in ancient manuscripts; at times, we skirted rivers and streams, their broad stony banks suggestive of recurrent inundations. It requires a copious volume of water, flowing vigorously, to cleanse the outer margins of a river. Each station teemed with groups, sometimes throngs, of individuals garbed in assorted attire. Some resembled rustic peasants akin to those in my homeland or encountered during my travels through France and Germany, clad in short jackets, round hats, and homespun trousers; others exuded a picturesque allure. The women appeared comely from a distance, albeit somewhat ungainly about the midriff. Adorned with billowing white sleeves and adorned with voluminous belts festooned with fluttering strips akin to ballet costumes, most wore petticoats beneath. The most striking figures were the Slovaks, who appeared more uncouth than the rest, sporting large cowboy hats, baggy off-white trousers, linen shirts, and massive leather belts embellished with brass studs. Their high boots housed tucked-in trousers, and their lengthy black hair and thick black mustaches lent them an air of exoticism, reminiscent of antiquated Oriental bandits. Nonetheless, I am informed that they are benign, lacking in innate assertiveness.\n\nAs twilight veered toward darkness, we arrived at Bistritz, an engrossing ancient town. Situated on the cusp of the frontier—given that the Borgo Pass links it to Bukovina—it has weathered a tumultuous history, evident in its timeworn visage. Fifty"
